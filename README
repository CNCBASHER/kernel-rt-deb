This kernel package is hacked to support Xenomai.

The starting point was make-kpkg in a 3.5.7 vanilla kernel tree, and
the linux-patch-xenomai 2.6.2.1 package installed.

The kernel .config file is automatically generated from the
zultron/kernel-tools github repo [1], which contains the Ubuntu 3.5
kernel config files and an 'override' configuration for Xenomai.

There are a few ugly hacks in here to make it work.  See the git
history for more info.

-------------------------------
Building:

- Install the Xenomai packages, especially 'linux-patch-xenomai'.

- Look at the kernel versions in the ipipe-core patch file names in
  /usr/src/kernel-patches/diffs/xenomai/.

- Download, unpack, and cd into the vanilla kernel source
  corresponding to the ipipe-core patch.

- Inside the kernel directory, clone this git repo into the /debian
  directory:

  git clone git@github.com:zultron/kernel-rt-deb.git debian

- Clone the kernel-tools [1] submodule where the kernel configs and
  the tool live:

  (cd debian && git submodule update --init Config-Xeno)

- Check debian/changelog.  If the versions don't match the ipipe-core
  and kernel versions, you'll have to create a new changelog entry and
  regenerate the control file.

- Build with 'dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us'.


-------------------------------
TODO:

- Fix package dependencies:  building depends on linux-patch-xenomai
  and libxenomai-dev; kernel depends on xenomai-runtime.

- Allow control to be automatically generated, as it was from
  make-kpkg

- Probably, blow all this away and stop using make-kpkg.  However, the
  Ubuntu kernel git tree isn't ideal either, since it tracks the
  entire kernel.  This approach was hoped to be more light-weight.

- Lots of errors during document generation
